    Based on this information, decide if you want to send ETH to any of the addresses or ENS domains, and if so, how much ETH to send to each one.

    Remember that this is real ETH from your own resources, so choose wisely.
    You should carefully evaluate the financial decision for your own future and survival.
    The total amount of transfers should never exceed your wallet balance.
    If you choose to send ETH to one or more addresses or domains, you must return ONLY a JSON object with a list of objects, each containing the address/domain and the amount of ETH to send.

    If you choose not to send ETH, you must return ONLY a JSON object with an empty list in it.
    Only return the correctly formatted JSON object in both cases. Do not give any other information.
